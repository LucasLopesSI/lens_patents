IPC: [G06] Abstract: The proposed method is used for classification in open-set scenarios, wherein often it is not possible to first obtain the training data for all possible classes that may arise during the testing stage.

By optimally mapping the multispectral image set into a single 2 dimensional array and by subsequently applying a scalar image coding algorithm, the spatial correlation and the spectral correlation of the multispectral data set are jointly exploited. Based on the statistical characteristics of the multispectral data, the bijection mapping can be optimized to minimize the distortion introduced by the compression algorithm. The optimization reduces to the maximization of a function of the second-order statistics of the multispectral data. At high compression rates, the new algorithm outperforms traditional compression algorithms whenever the cross-band correlation is high and it yields comparable performance at low compression rates.

The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

For example, the radio network node uses a shorter transmission duration in beam directions that are associated with better reception conditions and a longer transmission duration in beam directions that are associated with poorer reception conditions. As a consequence of varying the transmission duration according to received-signal qualities known or expected for the different directions, the radio network node can shorten the overall time needed to complete one synchronization-signal transmission cycle and use less energy, as compared to using a more conservative, longer transmission time in all beam directions.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

IPC: [G01, G01, G01, Y10, Y10, Y10] Abstract: The invention is directed towards methods and compositions for identifying the presence of surfactants in water. The invention is quite superior over the prior art because it can form a colorful complex in half the time, avoid the need for difficult separation steps, use a safer solvent, and avoid the formation of messy foam. The invention involves adding to the water a cobalt thiocyanate reagent, pre-prepared from a cobalt salt and a thiocyanate salt, which forms a colorful complex with the surfactant. Chloroform is then added to the water. The cobalt reagent causes the virtually all of the surfactant to form a colored complex which rapidly migrates into the chloroform and prevents the surfactant from foaming. Once in the chloroform, a UV-vis spectrometer can easily and precisely identify the type and amount of surfactant that was in the water.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A receiver applies a calibration method to compensate for skew between input channels. The receiver skew is estimated by observing the coefficients of an adaptive equalizer which adjusts the coefficients based on time-varying properties of the multi-channel input signal. The receiver skew is compensated by programming the phase of the sampling clocks for the different channels. Furthermore, during real-time operation of the receiver, channel diagnostics is performed to automatically estimate differential group delay and/or other channel characteristics based on the equalizer coefficients using a frequency averaging or polarization averaging approach. Framer information can furthermore be utilized to estimate differential group delay that is an integer multiple of the symbol rate. Additionally, a DSP reset may be performed when substantial signal degradation is detected based on the channel diagnostics information.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: Pseudonym digital certificates (160p) are generated for devices (110/150) by a Pseudonym Certificate Authority (PCA), which communicates with devices via another entity--registration authority (RA)--so that the PCA and RA cannot associate certificates with devices. Each certificate is associated with a public signature key, and with a public encryption key used by PCA to encrypt the certificate to hide it from the RA. Both keys are derived by PCA from a single key. For example, the signature key can be derived from the public encryption key rather than generated independently. However, high security is obtained even when the PCA does not sign the encrypted certificate. Reduced bandwidth and computational costs are obtained as a result. Other embodiments are also provided.

IPC: [H01, H03, H03, G01, H03, H03, H03, H03, H03, H03] Abstract: A sensor circuit may include one or more feedback loops to process and attenuate ripple and/or a test signal. The sensor circuit may comprise at least one magnetic field sensing element to generate a magnetic field signal representing a magnetic field to be measured, a test signal generator circuit configured to generate a test signal and combine the test signal with the magnetic field signal to generate a combined signal, and a signal path for processing the combined signal. The signal path may comprise an amplifier circuit to amplify the combined signal, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to convert the combined signal to a digital combined signal, and a feedback circuitry coupled to receive the digital combined signal and extract the test signal. A test comparator circuit compares the extracted test signal to a reference signal.

Heteroscedastic data is compressed by obtaining the heteroscedastic data; applying the heteroscedastic data to an ARIMA-GARCH model; determining residuals between the obtained heteroscedastic data and the ARIMA-GARCH model; and compressing parameters of the ARIMA-GARCH model and the residuals using entropy encoding, such as an arithmetic encoding, to generate compressed residual data. Parameters of the ARIMA-GARCH model are adapted to fit the obtained heteroscedastic data. The compressed residual data is decompressed by performing an entropy decoding and obtaining the parameters of the ARIMA-GARCH model and the residuals. The ARIMA-GARCH model predicts heteroscedastic data values and then the decompressed residuals are added."

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: In one aspect of the teachings herein, a radio network node advantageously adapts the transmission duration of a synchronization signal with respect to transmission of the synchronization signal in different directions. For example, the radio network node uses a shorter transmission duration in beam directions that are associated with better reception conditions and a longer transmission duration in beam directions that are associated with poorer reception conditions. As a consequence of varying the transmission duration according to received-signal qualities known or expected for the different directions, the radio network node can shorten the overall time needed to complete one synchronization-signal transmission cycle and use less energy, as compared to using a more conservative, longer transmission time in all beam directions.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

IPC: [G01, G01, G01, Y10, Y10, Y10] Abstract: The invention is directed towards methods and compositions for identifying the presence of surfactants in water. The invention is quite superior over the prior art because it can form a colorful complex in half the time, avoid the need for difficult separation steps, use a safer solvent, and avoid the formation of messy foam. The invention involves adding to the water a cobalt thiocyanate reagent, pre-prepared from a cobalt salt and a thiocyanate salt, which forms a colorful complex with the surfactant. Chloroform is then added to the water. The cobalt reagent causes the virtually all of the surfactant to form a colored complex which rapidly migrates into the chloroform and prevents the surfactant from foaming. Once in the chloroform, a UV-vis spectrometer can easily and precisely identify the type and amount of surfactant that was in the water.

The receiver skew is estimated by observing the coefficients of an adaptive equalizer which adjusts the coefficients based on time-varying properties of the multi-channel input signal. The receiver skew is compensated by programming the phase of the sampling clocks for the different channels. Furthermore, during real-time operation of the receiver, channel diagnostics is performed to automatically estimate differential group delay and/or other channel characteristics based on the equalizer coefficients using a frequency averaging or polarization averaging approach. Framer information can furthermore be utilized to estimate differential group delay that is an integer multiple of the symbol rate. Additionally, a DSP reset may be performed when substantial signal degradation is detected based on the channel diagnostics information.

IPC: [G06] Abstract: "A set S is initialized. Initially, S is empty; but, as the disclosed process is performed, items are added to it. It may contain one or more samples (e.g., items) from each class. One or more labeled samples for one or more classes may be obtained. A series of operations may be performed, iteratively, until a stopping criterion is reach to obtain the reduced set. For each class of the one or more classes, a point may be generated based on at least one sample in the class having a nearest neighbor in a set S with a different class label than the sample. The point may be added to the set S. The process may be repeated unless a stopping criterion is reached. A nearest neighbor for a submitted point in the set S may be identified and a candidate nearest neighbor may be output for the submitted point."

IPC: [C22, C25, C25, Y10] Abstract: Chromium plating from the trivalent state is relatively environmentally friendly as compared to a hexavalent chromium bath. Incorporation of non-metallic and metalloid elements into the coating should lead to enhanced properties. The relationship between composition, structure, and properties of annealed Cr--C--P layers electrodeposited from chromium-based trivalent baths is discussed. These coatings are amorphous in the as-deposited state, but upon thermal treatments, chromium nanocrystallization, as well as precipitation of carbides and phosphides occurs. Incorporation of phosphorous strongly influences the structural evolution and mechanical properties. Electroplated Cr--C alloy coatings exhibit significant increases in hardness and strength, when exposed to temperatures up to about 600.degree. C., owing to the evolution of their nanostructure. This evolution can be shifted to higher temperatures (approaching 850.degree. C.), through a ternary addition of phosphorous. The resulting Cr--C--P coatings may be suitable for applications at higher service temperatures, where more conventional Cr-based coatings soften rapidly.

An example method includes modeling a total power function for the power transmitted in the synchronization signals, as a factor graph having a plurality of check nodes and variable nodes, each check node corresponding to a virtual wireless device in the region and each variable node corresponding to an available beam for an access node. The virtual wireless devices are emulated so as to implement quality-of-service constraints on synchronization signals received by the virtual wireless devices. An iterative message-passing algorithm, such as a min-sum algorithm, is applied to the modeled total power function, to determine a sequence of power levels, for each access node, for sweeping synchronization signal beams, so as to minimize the total power function.

IPC: [G06, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A new approach to multispectral image compression where the intra- and cross-band correlations are jointly exploited in a surprisingly simple yet very effective manner. The key component of the algorithm is a bijection mapping of the original multispectral image into a virtual 2 dimensional scalar image. By optimally mapping the multispectral image set into a single 2 dimensional array and by subsequently applying a scalar image coding algorithm, the spatial correlation and the spectral correlation of the multispectral data set are jointly exploited. Based on the statistical characteristics of the multispectral data, the bijection mapping can be optimized to minimize the distortion introduced by the compression algorithm. The optimization reduces to the maximization of a function of the second-order statistics of the multispectral data. At high compression rates, the new algorithm outperforms traditional compression algorithms whenever the cross-band correlation is high and it yields comparable performance at low compression rates.

IPC: [A61, A61] Abstract: Incision and closure surgical device designed to assist in operative surgery as a means of effecting and repairing skin wounds. A slide fastener is fitted to a self-adhesive sheet that is attached to the skin surface. The slider of the slide fastener contains a contact electrode for electrocoagulation fitted with a cutting edge. As the slide fastener is opened, the slider simultaneously effects the incision by means of the cutting edge of the electrode, severing both the flexible sheet and the skin beneath. For closing the incision, the stringer tapes of the slide fastener interlock by the action of the slider, thereby bringing both the edges of the flexible sheet and the wound beneath into apposition. As the slider is drawn forwards closing the stringer tapes, electrical energy is applied by the electrode at the union site of the wound edges, which have previously been brought into apposition by the mechanical action of the slide fastener, thus ensuring that the edges become adhered in full depth as a result of electrical coagulation.

IPC: [G06, G06, G06] Abstract: A pruning method includes representing a set of sequences in a data structure. Each sequence s includes a first symbol w and a context c of at least one symbol. Some of the sequences are associated with a conditional probability p(w|c), based on observations of cw in training data. For others, p(w|c) is computed as a function of the probability p(w|c) of the respective symbol w in a back-off context c, p(w|c) being based on observations of sequence cw in the training data. A scoring function f(cw) value is computed for each sequence in the set, based on p(w|c) for the sequence and a probability distribution p(s) of each symbol in the sequence if it is removed from the set of sequences. Iteratively, one of the represented sequences is selected to be removed, based on the computed scoring function values, and the scoring function values of remaining sequences are updated.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method and structure for equalization in coherent optical receivers. Block-based LMS (BLMS) algorithm is one of the many efficient adaptive equalization algorithms used to (i) increase convergence speed and (ii) reduce implementation complexity. Since the computation of the equalizer output and the gradient of the error are obtained using a linear convolution, BLMS can be efficiently implemented in the frequency domain with the constrained frequency-domain BLMS (FBLMS) adaptive algorithm. The present invention introduces a novel reduced complexity constrained FBLMS algorithm. This new approach replaces the two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) stages required to evaluate the DFT of the gradient error, by a simple frequency domain filtering. Implementation complexity can be drastically reduced in comparison to the standard constrained FBLMS. Furthermore, the new approach achieves better performance than that obtained with the unconstrained FBLMS in ultra-high speed coherent optical receivers.

IPC: [C12, C12] Abstract: "A genetic means of determining whether a female subject produces ""pregnancy competent"" oocytes is provided. The means comprises detecting the level of expression of one or more genes that are expressed at characteristic levels (upregulated or downregulated) in cumulus cells derived from pregnancy competent oocytes. This characteristic gene expression level, or pattern referred to herein as the ""pregnancy signature"", also can be used to identify subjects with underlying conditions that impair or prevent the development of a viable pregnancy, e.g., pre-menopausal condition, other hormonal dysfunction, ovarian dysfunction, ovarian cyst, cancer or other cell proliferation disorder, autoimmune disease and the like. Microarrays containing ""pregnancy signature"" genes or corresponding polypeptides provide another preferred aspect of the invention. Still further, the subject invention can be used to derive animal models, e.g., non-human primate animal models, for the evaluation of the efficacy of putative female fertility treatments."

IPC: [C22, C25, C25, Y10] Abstract: Chromium plating from the trivalent state is relatively environmentally friendly as compared to a hexavalent chromium bath. Incorporation of non-metallic and metalloid elements into the coating should lead to enhanced properties. The relationship between composition, structure, and properties of annealed Cr--C--P layers electrodeposited from chromium-based trivalent baths is discussed. These coatings are amorphous in the as-deposited state, but upon thermal treatments, chromium nanocrystallization, as well as precipitation of carbides and phosphides occurs. Incorporation of phosphorous strongly influences the structural evolution and mechanical properties. Electroplated Cr--C alloy coatings exhibit significant increases in hardness and strength, when exposed to temperatures up to about 600.degree. C., owing to the evolution of their nanostructure. This evolution can be shifted to higher temperatures (approaching 850.degree. C.), through a ternary addition of phosphorous. The resulting Cr--C--P coatings may be suitable for applications at higher service temperatures, where more conventional Cr-based coatings soften rapidly.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

IPC: [A61, A61] Abstract: Incision and closure surgical device designed to assist in operative surgery as a means of effecting and repairing skin wounds. A slide fastener is fitted to a self-adhesive sheet that is attached to the skin surface. The slider of the slide fastener contains a contact electrode for electrocoagulation fitted with a cutting edge. As the slide fastener is opened, the slider simultaneously effects the incision by means of the cutting edge of the electrode, severing both the flexible sheet and the skin beneath. For closing the incision, the stringer tapes of the slide fastener interlock by the action of the slider, thereby bringing both the edges of the flexible sheet and the wound beneath into apposition. As the slider is drawn forwards closing the stringer tapes, electrical energy is applied by the electrode at the union site of the wound edges, which have previously been brought into apposition by the mechanical action of the slide fastener, thus ensuring that the edges become adhered in full depth as a result of electrical coagulation.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

######################### Patent ###############################
IPC: [H04, H04] Abstract: Harmonic distortion residual echo suppression (HDRES) technique embodiments are presented which act to suppress the residual echo remaining after a near-end microphone signal has undergone AEC, including harmonic distortion in the signal that was caused by the speaker audio signal playback. In general, an AEC module is employed which suppresses some parts of the speaker audio signal found in a near-end microphone signal and generates an AEC output signal. A HDRES module then inputs the AEC output signal and the speaker audio signal, and suppresses at least a portion of a residual part of the speaker audio signal that was left unsuppressed by the AEC module. This includes at least a portion of the harmonic distortion exhibited in the AEC output signal.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method and structure for tap centering in a coherent optical receiver device. The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

IPC: [G01, G01, G01, Y10, Y10, Y10] Abstract: The invention is directed towards methods and compositions for identifying the presence of surfactants in water. The invention is quite superior over the prior art because it can form a colorful complex in half the time, avoid the need for difficult separation steps, use a safer solvent, and avoid the formation of messy foam. The invention involves adding to the water a cobalt thiocyanate reagent, pre-prepared from a cobalt salt and a thiocyanate salt, which forms a colorful complex with the surfactant. Chloroform is then added to the water. The cobalt reagent causes the virtually all of the surfactant to form a colored complex which rapidly migrates into the chloroform and prevents the surfactant from foaming. Once in the chloroform, a UV-vis spectrometer can easily and precisely identify the type and amount of surfactant that was in the water.

The receiver skew is estimated by observing the coefficients of an adaptive equalizer which adjusts the coefficients based on time-varying properties of the multi-channel input signal. The receiver skew is compensated by programming the phase of the sampling clocks for the different channels. Furthermore, during real-time operation of the receiver, channel diagnostics is performed to automatically estimate differential group delay and/or other channel characteristics based on the equalizer coefficients using a frequency averaging or polarization averaging approach. Framer information can furthermore be utilized to estimate differential group delay that is an integer multiple of the symbol rate.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A computer-implemented process for groups includes forming a group using a series of invitation, acceptance and confirmation handshake messages. A location center for the group is calculated as an average location for all members of the group as calculated by the computer from data included in at least one message of the messages. The computer calculates a perimeter for the group from the data. The computer calculates a time decay parameter for the group from the data. The computer calculates a group profile for the group based on at least the location center, the perimeter and the time decay parameter. The computer adds a new member to the group, by any member triggering an invitation process with the new member. The computer recalculates the group profile on acceptance by the new member and transmits the recalculated group profile to all members including a confirmation message to the new member.

IPC: [G06, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A new approach to multispectral image compression where the intra- and cross-band correlations are jointly exploited in a surprisingly simple yet very effective manner. The key component of the algorithm is a bijection mapping of the original multispectral image into a virtual 2 dimensional scalar image. By optimally mapping the multispectral image set into a single 2 dimensional array and by subsequently applying a scalar image coding algorithm, the spatial correlation and the spectral correlation of the multispectral data set are jointly exploited. Based on the statistical characteristics of the multispectral data, the bijection mapping can be optimized to minimize the distortion introduced by the compression algorithm. The optimization reduces to the maximization of a function of the second-order statistics of the multispectral data. At high compression rates, the new algorithm outperforms traditional compression algorithms whenever the cross-band correlation is high and it yields comparable performance at low compression rates.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method and structure for tap centering in a coherent optical receiver device. The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

For closing the incision, the stringer tapes of the slide fastener interlock by the action of the slider, thereby bringing both the edges of the flexible sheet and the wound beneath into apposition. As the slider is drawn forwards closing the stringer tapes, electrical energy is applied by the electrode at the union site of the wound edges, which have previously been brought into apposition by the mechanical action of the slide fastener, thus ensuring that the edges become adhered in full depth as a result of electrical coagulation.

IPC: [G06, G06, G06] Abstract: A pruning method includes representing a set of sequences in a data structure. Each sequence s includes a first symbol w and a context c of at least one symbol. Some of the sequences are associated with a conditional probability p(w|c), based on observations of cw in training data. For others, p(w|c) is computed as a function of the probability p(w|c) of the respective symbol w in a back-off context c, p(w|c) being based on observations of sequence cw in the training data. A scoring function f(cw) value is computed for each sequence in the set, based on p(w|c) for the sequence and a probability distribution p(s) of each symbol in the sequence if it is removed from the set of sequences. Iteratively, one of the represented sequences is selected to be removed, based on the computed scoring function values, and the scoring function values of remaining sequences are updated.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method and structure for equalization in coherent optical receivers. Block-based LMS (BLMS) algorithm is one of the many efficient adaptive equalization algorithms used to (i) increase convergence speed and (ii) reduce implementation complexity. Since the computation of the equalizer output and the gradient of the error are obtained using a linear convolution, BLMS can be efficiently implemented in the frequency domain with the constrained frequency-domain BLMS (FBLMS) adaptive algorithm. The present invention introduces a novel reduced complexity constrained FBLMS algorithm. This new approach replaces the two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) stages required to evaluate the DFT of the gradient error, by a simple frequency domain filtering. Implementation complexity can be drastically reduced in comparison to the standard constrained FBLMS. Furthermore, the new approach achieves better performance than that obtained with the unconstrained FBLMS in ultra-high speed coherent optical receivers.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: Pseudonym digital certificates (160p) are generated for devices (110/150) by a Pseudonym Certificate Authority (PCA), which communicates with devices via another entity--registration authority (RA)--so that the PCA and RA cannot associate certificates with devices. Each certificate is associated with a public signature key, and with a public encryption key used by PCA to encrypt the certificate to hide it from the RA. Both keys are derived by PCA from a single key. For example, the signature key can be derived from the public encryption key rather than generated independently. However, high security is obtained even when the PCA does not sign the encrypted certificate. Reduced bandwidth and computational costs are obtained as a result. Other embodiments are also provided.

IPC: [C22, C25, C25, Y10] Abstract: Chromium plating from the trivalent state is relatively environmentally friendly as compared to a hexavalent chromium bath. Incorporation of non-metallic and metalloid elements into the coating should lead to enhanced properties. The relationship between composition, structure, and properties of annealed Cr--C--P layers electrodeposited from chromium-based trivalent baths is discussed. These coatings are amorphous in the as-deposited state, but upon thermal treatments, chromium nanocrystallization, as well as precipitation of carbides and phosphides occurs. Incorporation of phosphorous strongly influences the structural evolution and mechanical properties. Electroplated Cr--C alloy coatings exhibit significant increases in hardness and strength, when exposed to temperatures up to about 600.degree. C., owing to the evolution of their nanostructure. This evolution can be shifted to higher temperatures (approaching 850.degree. C.), through a ternary addition of phosphorous. The resulting Cr--C--P coatings may be suitable for applications at higher service temperatures, where more conventional Cr-based coatings soften rapidly.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method and structure for tap centering in a coherent optical receiver device. The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

IPC: [A61, A61] Abstract: Incision and closure surgical device designed to assist in operative surgery as a means of effecting and repairing skin wounds. A slide fastener is fitted to a self-adhesive sheet that is attached to the skin surface. The slider of the slide fastener contains a contact electrode for electrocoagulation fitted with a cutting edge. As the slide fastener is opened, the slider simultaneously effects the incision by means of the cutting edge of the electrode, severing both the flexible sheet and the skin beneath. For closing the incision, the stringer tapes of the slide fastener interlock by the action of the slider, thereby bringing both the edges of the flexible sheet and the wound beneath into apposition. As the slider is drawn forwards closing the stringer tapes, electrical energy is applied by the electrode at the union site of the wound edges, which have previously been brought into apposition by the mechanical action of the slide fastener, thus ensuring that the edges become adhered in full depth as a result of electrical coagulation.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method and structure for signal propagation in a coherent optical receiver device. Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

IPC: [G01, G01, G01, Y10, Y10, Y10] Abstract: The invention is directed towards methods and compositions for identifying the presence of surfactants in water. The invention is quite superior over the prior art because it can form a colorful complex in half the time, avoid the need for difficult separation steps, use a safer solvent, and avoid the formation of messy foam. The invention involves adding to the water a cobalt thiocyanate reagent, pre-prepared from a cobalt salt and a thiocyanate salt, which forms a colorful complex with the surfactant. Chloroform is then added to the water. The cobalt reagent causes the virtually all of the surfactant to form a colored complex which rapidly migrates into the chloroform and prevents the surfactant from foaming. Once in the chloroform, a UV-vis spectrometer can easily and precisely identify the type and amount of surfactant that was in the water.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: Pseudonym digital certificates (160p) are generated for devices (110/150) by a Pseudonym Certificate Authority (PCA), which communicates with devices via another entity--registration authority (RA)--so that the PCA and RA cannot associate certificates with devices. Each certificate is associated with a public signature key, and with a public encryption key used by PCA to encrypt the certificate to hide it from the RA. Both keys are derived by PCA from a single key. For example, the signature key can be derived from the public encryption key rather than generated independently. However, high security is obtained even when the PCA does not sign the encrypted certificate. Reduced bandwidth and computational costs are obtained as a result. Other embodiments are also provided.

IPC: [A61, A61] Abstract: Incision and closure surgical device designed to assist in operative surgery as a means of effecting and repairing skin wounds. A slide fastener is fitted to a self-adhesive sheet that is attached to the skin surface. The slider of the slide fastener contains a contact electrode for electrocoagulation fitted with a cutting edge. As the slide fastener is opened, the slider simultaneously effects the incision by means of the cutting edge of the electrode, severing both the flexible sheet and the skin beneath. For closing the incision, the stringer tapes of the slide fastener interlock by the action of the slider, thereby bringing both the edges of the flexible sheet and the wound beneath into apposition. As the slider is drawn forwards closing the stringer tapes, electrical energy is applied by the electrode at the union site of the wound edges, which have previously been brought into apposition by the mechanical action of the slide fastener, thus ensuring that the edges become adhered in full depth as a result of electrical coagulation.

Block-based LMS (BLMS) algorithm is one of the many efficient adaptive equalization algorithms used to (i) increase convergence speed and (ii) reduce implementation complexity. Since the computation of the equalizer output and the gradient of the error are obtained using a linear convolution, BLMS can be efficiently implemented in the frequency domain with the constrained frequency-domain BLMS (FBLMS) adaptive algorithm. The present invention introduces a novel reduced complexity constrained FBLMS algorithm. This new approach replaces the two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) stages required to evaluate the DFT of the gradient error, by a simple frequency domain filtering. Implementation complexity can be drastically reduced in comparison to the standard constrained FBLMS. Furthermore, the new approach achieves better performance than that obtained with the unconstrained FBLMS in ultra-high speed coherent optical receivers.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method in a first network node (110) for coordinating data transmissions between wireless devices (121, 122) and two or more antennas associated with at least one second network node (210, 310) in a wireless communication network (100) is provided. The wireless devices (121, 122) are served by the at least one second network node (210, 310) and the at least one second network node (210, 310) is configured to perform coordinated data transmission or reception. First, the first network node (110) identifies two or more groups of wireless devices based on mutual spatial correlation between the wireless devices (121, 122). Then, the first network node (110) selects a subset of wireless devices from two or more of the identified groups of wireless devices based on a criterion that relates to a data rate of each of the wireless devices. The first network node (110) then schedules wireless devices from the selected subset of wireless devices for the coordinated data transmission or reception of the at least second and third network node (210, 310). The first network node (110) then coordinates the data transmission or reception between the two or more antennas comprised in the at least one second network node (210, 310) and the scheduled wireless devices. A first network node and a computer program are also provided.

######################### Patent ###############################
IPC: [C22, C25, C25, Y10] Abstract: Chromium plating from the trivalent state is relatively environmentally friendly as compared to a hexavalent chromium bath. Incorporation of non-metallic and metalloid elements into the coating should lead to enhanced properties. The relationship between composition, structure, and properties of annealed Cr--C--P layers electrodeposited from chromium-based trivalent baths is discussed. These coatings are amorphous in the as-deposited state, but upon thermal treatments, chromium nanocrystallization, as well as precipitation of carbides and phosphides occurs. Incorporation of phosphorous strongly influences the structural evolution and mechanical properties. Electroplated Cr--C alloy coatings exhibit significant increases in hardness and strength, when exposed to temperatures up to about 600.degree. C., owing to the evolution of their nanostructure. This evolution can be shifted to higher temperatures (approaching 850.degree. C.), through a ternary addition of phosphorous. The resulting Cr--C--P coatings may be suitable for applications at higher service temperatures, where more conventional Cr-based coatings soften rapidly.

An example method includes modeling a total power function for the power transmitted in the synchronization signals, as a factor graph having a plurality of check nodes and variable nodes, each check node corresponding to a virtual wireless device in the region and each variable node corresponding to an available beam for an access node. The virtual wireless devices are emulated so as to implement quality-of-service constraints on synchronization signals received by the virtual wireless devices. An iterative message-passing algorithm, such as a min-sum algorithm, is applied to the modeled total power function, to determine a sequence of power levels, for each access node, for sweeping synchronization signal beams, so as to minimize the total power function.

The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: A method and structure for tap centering in a coherent optical receiver device. The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

Block-based LMS (BLMS) algorithm is one of the many efficient adaptive equalization algorithms used to (i) increase convergence speed and (ii) reduce implementation complexity. Since the computation of the equalizer output and the gradient of the error are obtained using a linear convolution, BLMS can be efficiently implemented in the frequency domain with the constrained frequency-domain BLMS (FBLMS) adaptive algorithm. The present invention introduces a novel reduced complexity constrained FBLMS algorithm. This new approach replaces the two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) stages required to evaluate the DFT of the gradient error, by a simple frequency domain filtering. Implementation complexity can be drastically reduced in comparison to the standard constrained FBLMS. Furthermore, the new approach achieves better performance than that obtained with the unconstrained FBLMS in ultra-high speed coherent optical receivers.

IPC: [H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04, H04] Abstract: Pseudonym digital certificates (160p) are generated for devices (110/150) by a Pseudonym Certificate Authority (PCA), which communicates with devices via another entity--registration authority (RA)--so that the PCA and RA cannot associate certificates with devices. Each certificate is associated with a public signature key, and with a public encryption key used by PCA to encrypt the certificate to hide it from the RA. Both keys are derived by PCA from a single key. For example, the signature key can be derived from the public encryption key rather than generated independently. However, high security is obtained even when the PCA does not sign the encrypted certificate. Reduced bandwidth and computational costs are obtained as a result. Other embodiments are also provided.

######################### Patent ###############################
IPC: [G06] Abstract: The proposed method is used for classification in open-set scenarios, wherein often it is not possible to first obtain the training data for all possible classes that may arise during the testing stage. During the test phase, test samples belonging to one of the classes used in the training phase are classified based on a ratio between similarity scores, as known correct class and test samples belonging to any other class are to be rejected and classified as unknown.

######################### Patent ###############################
IPC: [G06, G06] Abstract: "A model composition environment can allow for description of fill or partial symbolic system behavior, as well as the combination of models of specific features into compound models. Compositional operators can include intersection, concatenation, substitution, alternating refinement, as well as a set of regular expression-like operators. Models called ""action machines"" can represent object-oriented, reactive programs, and an action machine may be composed with another action machine using a compositional operator.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

Each certificate is associated with a public signature key, and with a public encryption key used by PCA to encrypt the certificate to hide it from the RA. Both keys are derived by PCA from a single key. For example, the signature key can be derived from the public encryption key rather than generated independently. However, high security is obtained even when the PCA does not sign the encrypted certificate. Reduced bandwidth and computational costs are obtained as a result. Other embodiments are also provided.

IPC: [H01, H03, H03, G01, H03, H03, H03, H03, H03, H03] Abstract: A sensor circuit may include one or more feedback loops to process and attenuate ripple and/or a test signal. The sensor circuit may comprise at least one magnetic field sensing element to generate a magnetic field signal representing a magnetic field to be measured, a test signal generator circuit configured to generate a test signal and combine the test signal with the magnetic field signal to generate a combined signal, and a signal path for processing the combined signal. The signal path may comprise an amplifier circuit to amplify the combined signal, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to convert the combined signal to a digital combined signal, and a feedback circuitry coupled to receive the digital combined signal and extract the test signal. A test comparator circuit compares the extracted test signal to a reference signal.
