Techniques for determining beam-sweeping patterns for synchronization signals transmitted in a region by several access nodes in a network, where each access node is connected to a corresponding array of antenna elements. An example method includes modeling a total power function for the power transmitted in the synchronization signals, as a factor graph having a plurality of check nodes and variable nodes, each check node corresponding to a virtual wireless device in the region and each variable node corresponding to an available beam for an access node. The virtual wireless devices are emulated so as to implement quality-of-service constraints on synchronization signals received by the virtual wireless devices. An iterative message-passing algorithm, such as a min-sum algorithm, is applied to the modeled total power function, to determine a sequence of power levels, for each access node, for sweeping synchronization signal beams, so as to minimize the total power function.

A method and structure for signal propagation in a coherent optical receiver device. Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.

A pruning method includes representing a set of sequences in a data structure. Each sequence s includes a first symbol w and a context c of at least one symbol. Some of the sequences are associated with a conditional probability p(w|c), based on observations of cw in training data. For others, p(w|c) is computed as a function of the probability p(w|c) of the respective symbol w in a back-off context c, p(w|c) being based on observations of sequence cw in the training data. A scoring function f(cw) value is computed for each sequence in the set, based on p(w|c) for the sequence and a probability distribution p(s) of each symbol in the sequence if it is removed from the set of sequences. Iteratively, one of the represented sequences is selected to be removed, based on the computed scoring function values, and the scoring function values of remaining sequences are updated.

A method of updating a suffix tree includes providing an initial suffix tree based on a first sequence of symbols drawn from an alphabet. The suffix tree includes existing nodes representing respective subsequences occurring in the first sequence of symbols. The existing nodes are associated with information relating to membership of the subsequences in at least one class of repeat subsequences. A second sequence of symbols is received and the initial suffix tree is updated to form an updated suffix tree by adding new nodes representing subsequences occurring in the second sequence of symbols that are not represented by the existing nodes. The subsequences represented by the new nodes are ordered in a new node data structure which is processed to updating the information relating to the at least one class of repeat subsequences associated with at least some of the nodes in the updated suffix tree.

A method for performing intrastromal ophthalmic laser surgery requires Laser Induced Optical Breakdown (LIOB) of stromal tissue without compromising Bowman's capsule (membrane). In detail, the method creates cuts in the stroma over all, or portions of, a plurality of concentric cylindrical surfaces (circular or oval). Importantly, these cuts are all centered on the visual axis of the patient's eye. In accordance with the present invention, cuts can be made either alone or in conjunction with the removal of predetermined volumes of stromal tissue. The actual location of cuts in the surgery will depend on whether the treatment is for presbyopia, myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism.

A system, method and computer program product for disambiguating one or more entity mentions in one or more documents. The method facilitates the simultaneous linking entity mentions in a document based on convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks that model both the local and global features for entity linking. The framework uses the capacity of convolution neural networks to induce the underlying representations for local contexts and the advantage of recurrent neural networks to adaptively compress variable length sequences of predictions for global constraints. The RNN functions to accumulate information about the previous entity mentions and/or target entities, and provide them as the global constraints for the linking process of a current entity mention.

Also, a TR loop is provided, enabling computing, by an error evaluation module, a first sampling phase error (SPE) and computing, by a timing phase information (TPI) module coupled to the error evaluation module, a second SPE from a plurality of CD equalizer taps PMD equalizer taps. The first and second SPE are combined into a total phase error (TPE) in a combining module, and the resulting TPE is filtered by a timing recovery (TR) filter coupled to an interpolated timing recovery (ITR) module and the combining module. The ITR module then synchronizes an input signal of the coherent optical receiver according to the TPE.

Pseudonym digital certificates (160p) are generated for devices (110/150) by a Pseudonym Certificate Authority (PCA), which communicates with devices via another entity--registration authority (RA)--so that the PCA and RA cannot associate certificates with devices. Each certificate is associated with a public signature key, and with a public encryption key used by PCA to encrypt the certificate to hide it from the RA. Both keys are derived by PCA from a single key. For example, the signature key can be derived from the public encryption key rather than generated independently. However, high security is obtained even when the PCA does not sign the encrypted certificate. Reduced bandwidth and computational costs are obtained as a result. Other embodiments are also provided.
